# Pixel start-page

Dynamic start-page using retro/pixel-art style.

i'm using Svelte and ness.css to create the UI.

'Why svelte?' you may ask. the reason that i'm using svelte is just for learning purposes not technical or perfomance related.

this project isn't ready yet. Here my plans:

- Open to Hacktoberfest
- Settings Menu
- Custom zones
- Pixel icons library
- Dark Theme
- Offline support
- Sync support
- and expect a lot of bugs


## How to use

This start-page is in development. my plans is to find a easy and free way to users install and use.

if you want to use the early version of this page you can run `npm install` and `npm run build` and this will genarate the site files on `public/build` directory.

then you can self host using Netlify, Firebase, Now or whatever hosting provider you want. firefox have handy extension to host direct from your machine.
